Stu-what ?
==========

Stupyd will transform a special, simplified C/C++ code to a valid C/C++ code.
It's still 100% C/C++, only the appearance changes. 


Why ?
=====
Because "beautiful is better than ugly".


Example code
============
#include <stdio.h>

int main():
    for int i=0; i<10; i++:
        printf("Hello World.\n")


Dependencies
============
Stupyd is coded in python3.


Limitations
===========
The following C/C++ features are not supported for now:
 - /**/ comments
 - enums

Code is ugly and slow, I don't care.
